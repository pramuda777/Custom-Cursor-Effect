## Features

- Smooth movement of cursor on the page
- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation

## Demo

Hover over the page to see the custom cursor in action!

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-cursor-effect.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the effect.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the cursor effect.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the custom cursor.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file that handles the cursor movement based on mouse position.

## Future Enhancements
